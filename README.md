**Objective:**
To understand how classification models work by using a Decision Tree to predict outcomes from a dataset.

**Tools & Libraries Used:**

Python – Core language for coding

Scikit-learn (sklearn) – For model creation, training, prediction, and evaluation

Pandas – For data loading and preprocessing

Matplotlib & Graphviz – To visualize the Decision Tree

**Why it’s useful:**
Decision Trees are foundational in machine learning. This task teaches you how to:

Load and prepare data

Train a supervised model

Evaluate performance (accuracy, classification report)

Interpret results using a visual tree
